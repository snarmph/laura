                <p>Some rituals are spoken of only in nightmares.<br>
                Others are buried beneath layers of silence,<br>
                sealed away by those who knew the cost of remembering.</p>
                <p><strong>This is one of those rituals.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>They call it "transference." Others have no name for it at all.</strong><br>
                Only scattered references remain. Burned journals, forbidden manuscripts, scribbled warnings found beside dead men with smiles carved into their cheeks.</p>
        
                <p>Eternal life is not granted.<br>
                It is taken.</p>
        
                <p>The first known <em>witness</em> was Varek the Third, writing sometime in the mid-1300s.<br>
                A scholar. A proto-scientist. A heretic.<br>
                He documented the case of a child (identity redacted, possibly erased) who underwent a sudden and unnatural transformation.</p>
        
                <p>Depressed. Withdrawn.<br>
                Then, overnight, lucid. Cold. Controlled.<br>
                This change came shortly after the violent, self-inflicted death of the child’s father... in full view of the child.</p>
        
                <p>Varek interviewed the boy. What the child told him was not human.</p>

                <h2>THE RITUAL:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>A parent births a child. Raises them.</li>
                    <li>Through subtle means: abuse, manipulation, gaslighting, the parent weakens the child’s psyche. Undermines their sense of self. <em>“Break the ego. Strip the will.”</em></li>
                    <li>When the child’s mind is at its lowest, when identity crumbles, the parent must perform a violent suicide <strong>in front of the child</strong>. It must be immediate. Traumatic. Utterly irreversible.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>This is the window.</strong><br>
                The soul of the parent, unbound by flesh, slips into the child’s now-vacant shell.</p>
                <p>If done perfectly, the child is erased.<br>
                The parent lives on. Reborn. Immortal.<br>
                A second life in the same blood.</p>

                <h2>BUT IF THE CHILD RESISTS...</h2>
                <p>If the child's soul clings, if even the faintest trace remains,<br>
                then the ritual fails.</p>
                <p>Partially.</p>
                <p>The parent enters, but does not take control.<br>
                They are trapped within the child’s mind, conscious but paralyzed.<br>
                A ghost behind the eyes. A prisoner in skin that is not theirs.</p>

                <h2>THE SECOND CHANCE:</h2>
                <p>It is not over.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wait until the child is weak again. Sick. Depressed. Drugged. Grieving.</li>
                    <li>Then, begin the invasion.<br>
                        Twist their dreams.<br>
                        Project hallucinations.<br>
                        Remind them of <em>the moment</em>.<br>
                        Make them remember what they tried to forget.</li>

                <p>When the soul fractures once more, when they begin to question what is real.<br>
                <strong>That, is your chance.</strong></p>
                <p>Push.<br>
                Take.<br>
                Finish what you started.</p>
